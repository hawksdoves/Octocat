git clone repo cloned-repo
This copies the repo into a new cloned-repo, s.t. there are now 2 repos

The cloned-repo recognises the remote repo (recognises it as the "origin").

Note that the cloned-repo does not recognise any branches that were in the original repo, as branches in the remote repo are not treated as local branches.

If update original can pull the updates to cloned-repo by:	 git pull (whilst being in the cloned-repo)
