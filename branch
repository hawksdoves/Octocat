The default branch name in Git is master. As you initially make commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.

You can create new branches. This is useful when sharing a project, as individuals can create their own branches from a particular hash (point in time), which will allow us to revert back to the project prior to any changes made by others.

If checkout (move to) original branch, the master will point to the last commit before a branch was created. If you then checkout branchName, the master will point to the last commit of that branch (assuming that no branches from current branch).
